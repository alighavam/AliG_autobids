# AliG_autobids
 my autboids shell script to use on CBS VDI. It just uses Khan's lab scripts but probably fixes a couple of probelms related to CBS server cache. You could just use Khan's lab tar2bids if you don't have those problems. Refer to this guide: https://diedrichsenlab.github.io/guides/09_autobids.html
